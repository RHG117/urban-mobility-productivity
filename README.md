# Urban Mobility & Economic Productivity Analysis – LATAM Cities
## Project Overview

Urban mobility plays a critical role in economic productivity and quality of life. This project analyzes how traffic congestion and travel delays relate to economic performance indicators such as GDP per capita and unemployment across major Latin American cities.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support transport infrastructure investment decisions.

## Business Problem

Policy makers and development institutions need to understand:
Which cities suffer from high congestion and low economic productivity
Which cities show efficient mobility and strong economic performance
Which mobility variables are most strongly associated with productivity
Without a unified dataset, it is difficult to compare cities and prioritize investments.

## Data Sources

TomTom Traffic Index
Urban traffic congestion, delays, travel times
OECD Cities Database
GDP per capita, unemployment, population, air pollution
Both datasets were integrated and analyzed for LATAM cities (2024).

## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
2. Standardized city and country names
3. Converted data types and handled missing values
4. Filtered data to LATAM cities and year 2024
5. Data Aggregation
6. Aggregated traffic metrics at the city–year level
7. Calculated average congestion, delay, and travel time indicators
8. Data Integration
9. Merged mobility and economic datasets into a single analysis-ready table
10. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
11. Analyzed relationships between congestion, GDP per capita, and unemployment
12. Identified patterns, trends, and outliers
13. Visualization & Insights
14. Created visualizations to highlight high-risk and high-opportunity cities

## Key Insights

Several cities exhibit high congestion combined with low GDP per capita, indicating priority areas for infrastructure investment.
Cities with lower travel delays tend to show higher economic productivity.
Traffic delay metrics show a stronger relationship with productivity than congestion volume alone.
